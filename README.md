Developed a custom, minimalist web platform designed to serve as a digital sandbox and creative outlet. Built entirely from scratch, TEKI functions as a central hub to host, document, and share technical projects, featuring a scalable structure to accommodate live program demos, code repositories, and technical walkthroughs.

Technical Stack:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Design/Styling: Custom CSS Layout

Future Integrations: Python (for backend logic or embedded applications)

Key Features & Implementation:

Foundational Front-End Development: Engineered from the ground up without relying on heavy content management systems or site builders. This demonstrates a strong, hands-on command of core web technologies and responsive document structuring.

Minimalist UI/UX Design: Features a clean, distraction-free interface with a distinct geometric aesthetic. The use of a neutral color palette with high-contrast teal accents ensures that the user's attention remains focused on the content and project showcases.

Scalable Project Architecture: Designed with a modular layout—including dedicated project tabs—to easily integrate and categorize future work. The site is built to handle various media types, from embedded demo videos to links for locally runnable programs.
